# InvestmentDecisionHelp

The main objective of this Big Data project is to develop a decision-making tool for investors in their choice of an investment asset or a vehicle. In this project, a complete processing chain (harvesting, storage, cleaning, exploration, valorization and visualization of data) will be represented.

I will divide this post in a series of articles, with the following plan (subject to change along the road):

1. Recolt data — scrapping 

2. Storage data — cassandra

3. cleaning & exploration data 

4. Web App that use a simple model in Python to estimate the properties price depending on its location or condition.

5. Improving the model with additional features and a better algorithm

6. Setup of a chatbot to chat with this App in natural language
